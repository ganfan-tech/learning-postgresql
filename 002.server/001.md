# Server Setup and Operation

## The PostgreSQL User Account

As with any server daemon that is accessible to the outside world, it is advisable to run PostgreSQL under a separate user account. This user account should only own the data that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other daemons.

## Creating a Database Cluster

一开始看到这个标题吓到我了，这是文档的第三章（第一章介绍文档主要内容，第二章介绍SQL）因为cluster有集群的意思，吓到了怎么一上了就讲集群。后来一看才知道不是这么回事儿，人家 database cluster 的意思是用一个数据库服务管理多个数据库实例。

A database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a single instance of a running database server.

初始化后，一个数据库群组会包含一个名为 postgres 的数据库

After initialization, a database cluster will contain a database named postgres, which is meant as a default database for use by utilities, users and third party applications. The database server itself does not require the postgres database to exist, but many external utility programs assume it exists. Another database created within each cluster during initialization is called template1. As the name suggests, this will be used as a template for subsequently created databases; it should not be used for actual work.
